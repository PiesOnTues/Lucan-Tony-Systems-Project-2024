1.  we assume that all mathematical operators ("*", "+", "-", "/") and assignment characters ("<-") 
    in ml are "spaced out" between the values upon which they operate.
    for example, in correct ml, printing the product of two variables ("a" and "b")
    should be expressed as:

        print a * b
    
    where;

        print a*b

    is incorrect
